This includes a decision authorizing a natural person to sign all papers and documents necessary to complete this (CHUNK 3).\n\n4. **Electronic Company File Maintenance**: The registrar maintains all registered data and a copy of the documents submitted to the company registry electronically for each company. This includes data and documents subject to publication according to the provisions of the law and other enforceable legislation, including payment receipts for the prescribed fees (CHUNK 4).\n\n5. **Documentation for Public Shareholding Company Registration**: The documents list specific requirements for initiating the registration process of a public shareholding company, including the founding contract signed by all founders, the internal system signed by all founders, and minutes of the founders' meeting detailing the appointment of the audit, the supervisory committee for the establishment procedures, and the authorized signatories during the establishment phase (CHUNK 5).\n\nThese details collectively affirm that the applicant is a legally registered entity with valid documentation as per the regulatory requirements mentioned in the provided project documents.", "meets_criterion": true, "sources": ["190_\u0645\u0639_\u0634\u0639\u0627\u0631_compressed-26-46.pdf"]}, {"name": "Experience", "question": "Does the applicant have at least 3 years of experience in humanitarian or development work?", "answer": "No, the provided project documents do not contain information regarding the applicant's experience in humanitarian or development work.

The mention of a bank certificate proving the submission of cash contributions to the capital and a report on in-kind contributions (CHUNK 4).
